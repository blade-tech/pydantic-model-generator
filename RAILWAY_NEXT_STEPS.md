# Railway Deployment - Next Steps (Research-Based)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

After deep research into Railway's build systems, I found the issue:

**Your logs show `Railpack 0.9.0` running** → This means Railway is NOT detecting the Dockerfile!

### Why Dockerfile Isn't Being Detected:

Railway looks for `Dockerfile` at the **service's root directory**:
- ✅ If Root Directory = blank → looks for `./Dockerfile` (repo root)
- ❌ If Root Directory = `backend` → looks for `backend/Dockerfile` (doesn't exist)

**The Dockerfile exists at repo root**, so Root Directory MUST be blank for Railway to find it.

---

## ✅ What We've Done (Files Ready)

- ✅ `Dockerfile` at repo root - Handles monorepo structure
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimizes build
- ✅ Updated environment variable docs
- ✅ Comprehensive research findings in `RAILWAY_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`

---

## 🚀 Critical Actions Required in Railway

### **Step 1: Verify Dockerfile Is Pushed to GitHub** ✅

Check: https://github.com/blade-tech/pydantic-model-generator/blob/main/Dockerfile

(Already done - Dockerfile was pushed)

---

### **Step 2: Configure Backend Service Settings** ⚠️

Go to Railway Dashboard → Backend Service → **Settings** tab:

#### A. Root Directory
```
Current: Might be set to "backend" (this breaks Dockerfile detection)
Required: [BLANK/EMPTY]
```

**How to fix**:
1. Find "Root Directory" setting
2. If it has ANY value, delete it completely
3. **Leave the field empty** - don't type anything
4. Save changes

#### B. Custom Start Command
```
Current: Might have a command
Required: [BLANK/EMPTY]
```

**How to fix**:
1. Find "Custom Start Command"
2. Delete any existing command
3. **Leave blank** - Dockerfile handles this
4. Save changes

#### C. Custom Build Command
```
Current: Might have a command
Required: [BLANK/EMPTY]
```

**How to fix**:
1. Find "Custom Build Command"
2. Delete any existing command
3. **Leave blank** - Dockerfile handles this
4. Save changes

---

### **Step 3: Update Environment Variables** 📝

Go to **Variables** tab:

**Change these**:
```env
# Update this path:
PYDANTIC_LIBRARY_PATH=./pydantic_library  ← Change to this

# Remove this if it exists:
API_PORT  ← DELETE this variable entirely
```

**Keep all these** (13 total):
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
NEO4J_URI=${{Neo4j.NEO4J_URI}}
NEO4J_USER=${{Neo4j.NEO4J_USER}}
NEO4J_PASSWORD=${{Neo4j.NEO4J_PASSWORD}}
PYDANTIC_LIBRARY_PATH=./pydantic_library
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.railway.app
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS=16384
CLAUDE_TEMPERATURE=0.7
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DEBUG=false
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

---

### **Step 4: Trigger Redeploy** 🔄

After clearing settings:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the "⋮" (three dots) menu
4. Select "Redeploy"
5. **Watch the build logs carefully!**

---

## 🎯 What to Look For in Build Logs

### ✅ SUCCESS - Dockerfile Detected:
```bash
✓ Using detected Dockerfile!
✓ Building with Docker
[1/6] FROM docker.io/library/python:3.11-slim
[2/6] WORKDIR /app
[3/6] COPY pydantic_library ./pydantic_library
[4/6] COPY backend ./backend
[5/6] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
[6/6] RUN cp -r /app/pydantic_library ./pydantic_library
✓ Successfully built image
✓ Starting deployment
```

### ❌ FAILURE - Still Using Railpack:
```bash
[Region: europe-west4]
╭────────────────╮
│ Railpack 0.9.0 │
╰────────────────╯

✖ Railpack could not determine how to build the app
```

**If you still see Railpack**: Root Directory is not blank. Double-check Settings.

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Before redeploying, verify in Railway:

### Settings Tab:
- [ ] Root Directory: **BLANK** (no text, empty field)
- [ ] Custom Build Command: **BLANK**
- [ ] Custom Start Command: **BLANK**
- [ ] Builder: Should show "Dockerfile" (auto-detected)

### Variables Tab:
- [ ] `PYDANTIC_LIBRARY_PATH` = `./pydantic_library`
- [ ] No `API_PORT` variable exists
- [ ] All 13 variables from `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.md` are set
- [ ] API keys are correct (from your local `.env`)

### GitHub:
- [ ] `Dockerfile` exists at repo root
- [ ] Latest commit includes Dockerfile changes

---

## 📊 Expected Build Timeline

After redeploy with correct settings:

```
[0:00] Cloning repository...
[0:10] Detecting Dockerfile... ✓
[0:15] Building image (layer 1/6)...
[2:00] Installing Python dependencies...
[3:00] Copying pydantic_library...
[3:30] Build complete ✓
[3:35] Starting container...
[3:40] Service healthy ✓
```

**Total time**: ~4-5 minutes for first build

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing Railpack in logs
**Cause**: Root Directory not properly cleared
**Fix**:
1. Go to Settings
2. Click into Root Directory field
3. Press `Ctrl+A` then `Delete` to clear
4. Click outside field to save
5. Redeploy

### Issue: "No such file or directory: pydantic_library"
**Cause**: Dockerfile path issue
**Fix**: Dockerfile is correct, ensure Root Directory is blank

### Issue: Build succeeds but app crashes
**Cause**: Environment variables or dependencies
**Fix**: Check runtime logs for specific error

## 🎯 Next Steps After Successful Backend Deploy

Once backend is running:

1. **Test Health Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend Service**:
   - Create new service in same project
   - Set Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Add env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<backend-url>`

3. **Update CORS**:
   - Update backend `CORS_ORIGINS` with frontend URL
   - Redeploy backend

4. **Test Full Workflow**:
   - Visit frontend URL
   - Run through all 6 steps
   - Verify file generation works

## 💡 Key Insight from Research

**The #1 mistake with Railway monorepos**:
> Setting Root Directory when using a custom Dockerfile at repo root

**Why it fails**: Railway looks for Dockerfile at the Root Directory, not at repo root.

**Solution**: Leave Root Directory blank ✅

---

**Ready to Deploy?**

1. Clear Root Directory ← Most important!
2. Update environment variables
3. Redeploy
4. Watch for "Using detected Dockerfile!"
5. Share logs if any issues

The research shows this should work once Root Directory is properly cleared!
