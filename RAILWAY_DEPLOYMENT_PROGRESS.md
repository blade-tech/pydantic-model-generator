**Estimated Time**: 3 minutes

---

## üöÄ Deployment Execution

### Initial Deployment
- [ ] Railway detects changes and starts build
- [ ] Backend service builds (Python dependencies install)
- [ ] Frontend service builds (npm dependencies install)
- [ ] Services deploy and start

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes (first build)

### Monitor Deployment
- [ ] Check build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify Python version detection (3.11+)
- [ ] Verify Node.js version detection (18+)
- [ ] Confirm no dependency errors

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend Health Checks
- [ ] Visit backend URL: `https://[backend-url].railway.app`
- [ ] Check health endpoint: `https://[backend-url].railway.app/health`
  - Expected response: `{"status": "healthy", "message": "...", "version": "1.0.0"}`
- [ ] Check API docs: `https://[backend-url].railway.app/docs`
  - Should show FastAPI Swagger UI

### Frontend Verification
- [ ] Visit frontend URL: `https://[frontend-url].railway.app`
- [ ] Verify Step 1 loads (Business Context Input)
- [ ] Check browser console for CORS errors (should be none)
- [ ] Confirm API connection in network tab

### Neo4j Verification
- [ ] Check Neo4j logs in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Verify no connection errors in backend logs
- [ ] (Optional) Connect to Neo4j browser at Railway URL

## üß™ End-to-End Testing

### Test Complete Workflow
- [ ] **Step 1**: Enter business context
  - Example: "Track customer support ticket resolution times"
  - Verify input saves to state

- [ ] **Step 2**: Run ontology research
  - Verify Claude API connection
  - Check streaming works
  - Confirm entities are suggested

- [ ] **Step 3**: Generate OutcomeSpec
  - Verify YAML generation
  - Check editable text area works
  - Approve and continue

- [ ] **Step 4**: Generate LinkML schema
  - Verify schema generation
  - Check for duplicate slot errors (should be auto-fixed)
  - Approve and continue

- [ ] **Step 5**: Generate Pydantic models
  - Verify subprocess execution works
  - Check file writes to pydantic_library/
  - Confirm generated Python code is valid

- [ ] **Step 6**: Run tests
  - Verify pytest subprocess works
  - Check test results display
  - Confirm all tests pass

### Verify File Persistence
- [ ] Check Railway volume for pydantic_library/
- [ ] Verify generated files persist across restarts
- [ ] Confirm multiple overlays can be created

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend won't start
- [ ] Check environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Verify Neo4j connection in logs
- [ ] Confirm PYDANTIC_LIBRARY_PATH is correct
- [ ] Check Python version (must be 3.11+)

#### CORS errors in frontend
- [ ] Verify CORS_ORIGINS includes frontend URL
- [ ] Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct
- [ ] Confirm backend is running

#### Subprocess execution fails
- [ ] Verify gen-pydantic is installed (in requirements.txt)
- [ ] Check file write permissions
- [ ] Review Railway build logs

#### Tests not running
- [ ] Confirm pytest-json-report is installed
- [ ] Verify PYTHONPATH is set correctly
- [ ] Check test file exists in pydantic_library/tests/
